The title element

The title element represent's the document's title or name.
Authors should use title that identify their documents even when they are used out of context, for example in a user's history of bookmarks, or in search results.
The document's title is often different from its first heading, since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of context.

There must be no more than one title element per document.

Example:
  Here are some examples of appropriate title, contrasted with the top-level headings that might be used on those same pages.

<title>Introduction to The Mating Rituals of Bees</title>
  ...
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  This companion guide to the highly successful <cite>Introduction to Medieval Bee-Keeping</cite> book is...
</p>

  The next page might be a part of the same site.
  Note how the title describes the subject matter unambiguously, while the first heading assumes the reader knows what the context is and therefore won't wonder if the dances are Salsa or Waltz:

<title>Dances used during bee mating rituals</title>
  ...
<h1>The Dances</h1>
