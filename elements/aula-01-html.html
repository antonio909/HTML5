The html element

The html element represents the root of an HTML document.

Authors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document's language.
This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use, translations tools to determine what rules to use, and so forth.

Example:
  The html element in the following example declares that the document's language is English.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Swapping Songs</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Swapping Songs</h1>
    <p>
      Tonight I swapped some of the songs I wrote with some friends, who gave me some of the songs they wrote.
      I love sharing my music.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
